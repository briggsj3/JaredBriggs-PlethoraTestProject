# PlethoraTestProject
A sample project made for Plethora.


# Assumptions:
-This software was written with the intent of readability, not necessarily efficiency.
-The minimum coordinates for both axis on the laser cutter are (0,0) (i.e., no negative coordinates).
-When checking bounds of a circular arc, only points at degree increments along the arc are checked.
-The specified padding amount is split between both sides of each dimension (i.e., the material used is 0.1 inches bigger in each dimension than the design to be cut).
